# Clustering-ass-2
IBM employs a network of expert consultants for various projects. To help determine how to distribute its bonuses, IBM wants to cluster groups of employees with similar performance based on key performance metrics. Each observation corresponds to an employee in the file ‘Big Blue’ and consists of values for (1) Usage Rate - which corresponds to the period proportion of time that the employee has been actively working on high priority projects, and (2) Recognition - which is the number of projects for which the employee involvement was specifically requested, and (3) Leader - which is the number of projects on which the employee has served as a project leader."
